# fitterest ingestion server

Hono service that turns a product link into a background-free garment cutout.
The API key lives here and never ships in the app bundle.

## Run

```bash
cd server
npm install
# add your key to .env
npm run dev
```

Listens on `0.0.0.0:8787` so a phone on the same Wi-Fi can reach it.

## Configure

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Required. Used for the cutout and the metadata fallback. |
| `CUTOUT_PROVIDER` | `openai` (default) or `youcam`. |
| `BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY` | Optional. Unlocks the bot-protected retailers. |
| `BRIGHTDATA_ZONE` | Required alongside the key — your Web Unlocker zone name. |
| `BRIGHTDATA_COUNTRY` | Optional two-letter exit country, e.g. `us`. |
| `PORT` | Defaults to `8787`. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth client id(s) allowed as an ID token audience, comma-separated. Unset = dev sign-ins only. |
| `DATA_FILE` | Where accounts and sessions are stored. Defaults to `server/data/users.json`. |

`.env` is gitignored. `.env.example` is the template.

## Endpoints

### `GET /health`
`{ ok, provider, hasKey, unblocker, sites }` — quick check that the keys are
actually loaded and how many retailers have tuned rules.

### `GET /api/sites`
`{ sites: [{ host, label }] }` — the retailers with per-host rules, for a
"works with…" list in the app.

### `POST /api/ingest`
```json
{ "url": "Loved this https://www.zara.com/...?utm_source=ig" }
```
`url` takes a raw paste, not just a clean URL — share text, a shortener
(`a.co`, `bit.ly`, `*.onelink.me`), or an Android `intent://` deep link all
resolve. Tracking params are stripped; variant params (`?v1=`, `?colourwayid=`)
are kept, since they pick the colour.
Returns:
```json
{
  "id": "item-1755...",
  "title": "Men Black Solid Round Neck T-shirt",
  "brand": "Roadster",
  "price": "INR 499",
  "image": "data:image/png;base64,...",
  "originalImage": "https://...",
  "pageUrl": "https://...",
  "extractedVia": "json-ld"
}
```

## Accounts

Google is the only identity provider — there is no email/password path and no
separate sign-up step, because Google has already told us who this is.

The client runs the OAuth flow and posts the resulting **ID token** here. The
server proves it came from Google (`src/google.js` → Google's `tokeninfo`
endpoint, plus its own audience and issuer checks), then creates or finds the
matching account and issues an opaque **session token**. Everything after that
is `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

Users and sessions live in one JSON file (`src/store.js`). That is a
hackathon-shaped decision: the working set fits in memory, and the module's
surface is the one a real repository would have, so moving to Postgres later
means rewriting that file and nothing else.

### `POST /api/auth/google`
```json
{ "idToken": "<Google ID token>" }
```
Returns `{ token, expiresAt, user }`. Sessions last 90 days.

Until `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is set the server has no way to verify a real token,
so it accepts a dev stand-in of the form `dev:<id>:<email>:<name>` instead —
letting profiles be built and demoed before OAuth is wired up. Setting the
client id turns that path off automatically; there is no flag to forget.

### `POST /api/auth/signout`
Bearer-authenticated. Drops this device's session only.

### `GET /api/me` · `PATCH /api/me`
Bearer-authenticated. `PATCH` accepts any of `name`, `handle`, `bio`,
`avatarUrl`, `modelPhotoUrl`. Handles are `[a-z0-9_]{3,20}` and unique;
a clash returns `409`.

### `GET /api/users/:handle`
Public profile. Email and model photo are never in this projection.

## How ingestion works

Four stages, each falling back only when the cheaper one fails.

**1. Normalise the link** (`links.js`) — pull the URL out of share text, follow
shorteners, drop tracking params.

**2. Fetch the page** (`fetchPage.js`) — a plain fetch shaped like a real
Chrome navigation (the `sec-fetch-*` set matters; a bare user-agent is no
longer enough). If the host is a known blocker, or the response is a challenge
page, or nothing parses out of it, the request is retried through Bright Data's
Web Unlocker. That tier costs money per request, so it never runs first.

**3. Find the product** (`extract.js`), in reliability order:

1. **JSON-LD `Product`** — walks `@graph` / `hasVariant` / nested nodes. Parsed
   leniently: a raw newline inside a string (a pasted customer review) makes
   `JSON.parse` reject the whole block, and that alone was costing us Myntra.
2. **Microdata** — `itemtype="schema.org/Product"`, common on Shopify themes.
3. **Embedded app state** — `__NEXT_DATA__`, `__NUXT__`, `__INITIAL_STATE__`.
   Scores every object in the blob and keeps the most product-shaped one, which
   is how the React storefronts (adidas, most SPAs) resolve.
4. **OpenGraph / Twitter meta** — `og:image`, `og:title`.
5. **Largest declared `<img>`** — last resort, srcset-aware, ≥300px wide.

The winning image URL then gets a per-retailer rewrite (`sites.js`) that swaps
the CDN's thumbnail token for a full-size one — cutout quality tracks input
resolution closely, and `og:image` is often a 400px crop. The original is kept
as a fallback in case the rewrite 404s.

An LLM (`gpt-4o-mini`) is only called when the page yields no title, so pages
with structured data cost nothing extra.

**4. Cut it out** — the image is downloaded (with a `referer`, or the CDNs
reject the hotlink) and sent to `images.edit` (`gpt-image-1`) with
`background: "transparent"`.

## Retailer coverage

`sites.js` carries per-host rules for ~50 retailers, global and Indian. A host
that is not in that table still works — it just gets the generic path.

Confirmed extracting over a plain fetch, no unblocker needed: **Myntra,
Bewakoof, Westside, Libas, Flipkart, Uniqlo, J.Crew, Madewell, Nike, Levi's.**
Myntra in particular returns full JSON-LD — title, brand, price and a 1080px
image — to an ordinary server fetch.

AJIO is the notable gap: its PDP is rendered from `window.__PRELOADED_STATE__`,
which the extractor reads, but its category pages and internal API sit behind
Akamai, so no live product code was available to confirm it end to end. A
shared AJIO product link should work; it is untested.

```bash
npm run coverage              # pass/fail table, one row per retailer
npm run coverage -- zara nike # filter by host
```

The table marks rows whose sample URL has not been confirmed live, since a dead
product link and a broken parser otherwise look identical. Only the confirmed
rows gate the exit code.

## Known limits

- **The bot-protected half needs Bright Data.** Amazon, Zara, H&M, ASOS, SHEIN,
  Nordstrom, Nike, SSENSE and friends refuse plain server fetches. Without
  `BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY` they fail with a message naming the reason; with it they
  go through the unblocker. This is not something a better parser fixes.
- **Sample product URLs rot.** Items sell out and 404. Replace the URL in
  `test/urls.js` rather than reading a regression into it.
- **Some retailers rate-limit rather than block.** adidas extracted fine for
  the first few requests, then started refusing this IP. A host that worked
  yesterday and fails today usually needs the unblocker, not a parser change.
- **The cutout is generative**, so it can subtly redraw fabric detail. For a
  shopping decision that matters — worth comparing against `originalImage`.
- **Cutouts return as base64 data URLs.** Fine for a demo; move to object
  storage before this holds many items, since they sit in memory.

## Swapping in YouCam

`src/providers/youcam.js` mirrors the OpenAI provider's signature
(`cutout(buffer) -> data URL`). Implement it, set `CUTOUT_PROVIDER=youcam`,
and nothing else changes. This matters because the hackathon requires at
least one YouCam API call — the OpenAI path alone would not qualify.
